# GitHub Action to get the required [Dagger](https://dagger.io/) version

This action gets the `engineVersion` field from the `dagger.json` file of a
repository.

It supports workflows with and without checking out the repository first:

- If the repository is with a `dagger.json` file is present, the action will get
  the `engineVersion` field from it
- If there is no checked out repository, the action will use the Contents API to
  get the `dagger.json` file
